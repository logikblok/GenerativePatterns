# GenerativePatterns

>> generative patterns made with p5js or processing
>> the canvas is always 600x600px
>> everytime the sketch runs it should generate a slightly different pattern

>> a screenshot of a pattern and its source code is shared everyday via Twitter @ociosoadias

>> you're free to download and remix every sketch
