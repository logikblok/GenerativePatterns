# GenerativeGrayscalePatterns

\>> generative patterns made with p5js or processing<br/>
\>> the canvas is always 600x600px<br/>
\>> all the sketches are grayscale<br/>
\>> everytime the sketch runs it should generate a slightly different pattern<br/><br/>

\>> a screenshot of a pattern and its source code is shared everyday via Twitter @ociosoadias<br/><br/>

\>> you're free to download and remix every sketch
