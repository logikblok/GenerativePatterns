# GenerativePatterns

\>> generative patterns made with p5js or processing<br/>
\>> the canvas is always 600x600px<br/>
\>> everytime the sketch runs it should generate a slightly different pattern<br/>
\>> in some sketches, it's possible to generate a new pattern by clicking with the mouse<br/><br/>

\>> a screenshot of a pattern and its source code is shared everyday via Twitter @ociosoadias<br/>
\>> you can see the screenshots in this Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/ociosoadias/status/989458169775710208<br/>

\>> you're free to download and remix every sketch
